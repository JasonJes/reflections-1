When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you have a group project or are working from multiple locations on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

So none of your work is tempered with expcept under the circumstance that you are ready for it to 
be.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

I would use a fork to make a copy of my friends repository on GitHub. I would clone anytime I want 
an existing repository on GitHub for a group project, or I wanted to have an existing project for 
myself without having my project on GitHub. I would branch anytime I needed multiple versions of 
the same project, or wanted to add a new feature to a group project that might take a while.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to see where you left off and decide on your own if you want to add in changes that 
others or yourself on a different system have made since this systems last pull.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be 
harder?

I would send code snippets I changed to the person in charge of merging code together. With github 
it takes care of who is in charge of each individual activity, and will send the requests to the 
person who the pertain to. It would me much harder to rewrite all the code than to allow github to 
combine it for you.
