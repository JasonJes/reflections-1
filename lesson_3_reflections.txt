When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you have a group project or are working from multiple locations on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-
date with your remote repository?

So none of your work is tempered with expcept under the circumstance that you are ready for it to 
be.
