What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you create a repository it is empty. The first step towards giving 
you use of git's features is making your first commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It allows you to add a file as you go to the following commit. This 
allows you to add several files in at different points in time. This 
also allows you to test new functionality out on a specific file 
without worrying that it will mess up your current commit.
